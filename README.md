# Icon-Request-Update
Please read - Reason for icon request being taken offline.

Okay guys, so i know this isn't the place at all to talk personal issues but I owe you all an explanation and an update on how future development is going to proceed. It has come to my attention recently that I have not been as good of a husband/father as I should be and I have been more attentive to this part of my life rather than what's truly important; showing my daughter what the world has to offer.

I can only hope that my daughter can find and surround herself with people that have been as amazing as all of you have. I have met so many amazing people and made some truly good friends that I hope I never lose contact with.

As for the future of my themes, I will be updating them as often as I possibly can. I will NOT be abandoning them. However, if it keeps interfering with my ability to be the proper support my family needs, then I will have to halt development for a undetermined amount of time. I have currently taken the request form offline though. But just know that whatever happens, THIS IS NOT THE END! I hope you all understand this. This is a very hard decision and it is definitely not a pleasant one but I know that it truly is the right one and I hope you can all understand the position that I have put myself in and why I am making these decisions. I love you all and I promise that I will be back someday!!

That said, I have made the themes free for EVERYONE TO ENJOY! My work was only ever set as paid packages to help assist my family during the quarantine. While it has brought some money in, I have essentially took away all meaning from my work by being so distant from my family. Since I am no longer able to work on them the way that a paid package should be, I have taken that price tag off. Stay safe everyone and please donâ€™t forget to tell your family how much you love them.

- Your friendly neighbor, spooter.
